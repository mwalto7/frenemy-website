# Frenemy

Rampant Co. is about to release *Frenemy*: a free-for-all with friends.
*Frenemy* is a 2D, multiplayer game where the last man standing is the
winner of the game. A single match supports up to four players. Each
player spawns into the match with three lives and their fists as their
only weapon, until someone picks up a weapon. Players can pick up
a variety of weapons, power-ups, and armor to gain the advantage over
their frenemies. Players eventually have to settle their differences
to fight the match boss together. Once defeated, the free-for-all is
back on.

Stay tuned for more about the release of our new game, *Frenemy*.

Thanks,

The team at Rampant Co.
